# Youtube-downloader
This will download any Youtube video you want. All you need to do is paste the link into the link section and change quality to whatever you want. If an error occurs, lower your quality.

1. Paste you link into the code
2. Change the quality, default is 360p
3. You can look for the comments in the code, it will direct you where to change the quality and link. I'm too lazy to make a user input

Im not sure if it works for higher than 720p, I know it works from 360-720p
